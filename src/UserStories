DONE As a developer, I want to start a new Java Project and create an App.java class that contains a main() method. 

DONE As a developer, I want to research “array literal” in Java so I can easily create three arrays of Strings. 

As a hero, I want my adventure to consist of a randomly chosen setting, weapon, and villain, chosen from my three Array[String]s. 

As a hero, I want the selected values to be saved in an ArrayList<String> called myAdventure. 

As a hero, I want to loop over myAdventure to display all the original selected values. 

As a hero, I want to be able to randomly re-select each of the values one at a time if chosen 

As a hero, I want to replace the original value in the ArrayList with the new one I have selected in the same spot. 

As a hero, I want to be given the option to reselect continually until I decide I am satisfied. 

As a hero, I want to display my completed adventure in the terminal.
